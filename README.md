# Sensor-ranking
Rank sensors with respect to their prediction power based on thier (binary) labeled data-readings.

The file Sensor_data.csv contains an artificially generated data set of 400 readings for 10 different sensor. 
The readings (data points) have been divided into two classes 1 or -1.

The sensors are ranked according to their importance/predictive power
with respect to the class labels.

Additionally, the methodology and analysis shed light on:

* thought-proces, i.e., step-bx-step approach to reach solution.
* properties of the artificially generated data set
* strengths of the method: why does it produce a reasonable result?
* weaknesses of the method: when would the method produce inaccurate results?
* scalability of the method with respect to number of features and/or samples
* alternative methods and their respective strengths, weaknesses, scalability
